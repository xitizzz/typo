### Understanding Crowd Behavior using Unsupervised Deep Neural Networks

* For this project we proposed two individual models for simulating crowd movement behavior in public places, such as railway stations.
* The proposed approaches include non-linear PCA based networks belonging to the autoencoders family (variational autoencoders among others), as well as deep generative models trained under an adversarial setting (generative adversarial network or GAN).
* We also developed a unique approach for crowd movement representation, it used probabilistic heat map generated with overlapping Gaussian kernels to simulate crowd densities.

### Proposing a Novel Method for Fake News Classification
* In this project after exhaustive study of current methods for fake news detection, we came up with ensemble model consisting two classifiers.
* First was a model with an information retrieval module and a feed forward neural network to integrate the knowledgebase for fake news detection. Second was style based classification model utilizing word embeddings and Bi-LSTM.

### Traffic Analysis from CCTV Footage (for CAIT)

* I worked on this project with Dr. Xiang Liu as part of my job at Center for Advance Infrastructure and Transportation (CAIT).
* For this project I developed a computer vision program to analyze the traffic from CCTV footage for Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation.
* The program would take a video file consisting CCTV footage at a railway crossing and computed count, relative speed, direction and time of crossing for both pedestrians and vehicles.
* The program achieved accuracy of 94% and computation time 60% less than actual video time, making it suitable for real time application.
* The project was oriented on creating computationally light weight video processing solution which can potentially be used on light weight systems (like raspberry pi) in real time.
* The program used background subtraction and Kalman filter for tracking and counting.

As this project is confidential, currently I am unable to share code and other details. I have asked for permission to share more.
