I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Black Knight Inc. I have completed MS in Computer Science from [Rutgers Univesity](https://www.rutgers.edu). While in school, I also worked as a Research Data Scientist with [Dr. Xiang Liu](https://cee.rutgers.edu/fac/xiang-liu) in the Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation.

I am interested in anything and everything that includes huge amount of data and/or complex coding (best if both). I am particularly interested if machine learning part of data science, as it is often the most exciting part and also the most challenging.
